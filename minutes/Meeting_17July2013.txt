Notes:
 - remove ranges for mortality
 - limit fluid analysis to first 3 days
 - change p-value to < 0.5
 - look at lactate, WBC and createnin during first 3 days: highest value, median
 - extract 10 echo reports at random of patients with CHF 
 - add vasopressor duration and dose analysis
 - extract SOFA and SAPS1 scores for first 3 days and day of echo
 - use Angus sepsis criteria
 - do landmark analysis (one year) of hospital survivors
 - see how many echos were taken on vasopressors
 - for hyperdynamic group, did they have other echos and if so were they still 
   hyperdynamic (i.e. acute or chronic)
