	   diomegaly. In addition, there is quite prominent right heart border, even allowi

	   olidation, or gross effusion is identified. Probable slight amount of pleural fl
	   uid or thickening at the left costophrenic angle and minimal bibasilar atelectas
	   is. The blunting of the left costophrenic angle is new compared to one day earli
	   er. Addendum: Review of the [**3269-10-22**] chest CT suggests that some of the
	   right heart prominence may be accounted for by overall shape of chest. .Chest, t

	   motion. The patient is kyphotic. There is moderate cardiomegaly. The aorta is ca
	   lcified and unfolded. There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF. No
	   focal consolidation or effusion is identified. There is minimal blunting of both
	    costophrenic angles. Some prominence of the right infrahilar region is essentia
	   lly unchanged from multiple prior films and more likely relates to atelectasis a
	   nd/or scarring. IMPRESSION: Minimal atelectasis at right base. No definite infil
	   trate. Upper zone redistribution without overt CHF..MRI Left elbow [**3272-8-1**
	   ]:TECHNIQUE: MR examination of the left elbow was performed. Axial and sagittal
	   T1-weighted images and axial inversion-recovery images were acquired. The patien
	   t subsequently complained of discomfort and the exam was terminated. Comparison
	   is made to the ultrasound exam dated [**3272-7-27**] and the elbow radiographs d
	   ated [**3272-7-27**]. FINDINGS: MR LEFT ELBOW WITHOUT CONTRAST: The olecranon bu
	   rsa is distended and contains heterogeneous high and low signal representing bur
	   sitis. Low signal foci within the olecranon bursa correspond to calcification se
	   en on the previous radiographs. An overlying surface marker is seen within the r
	   egion of the olecranon and the bursal findings likely account for the patient's
	   symptoms. The cortex of the adjacent olecranon appears intact. A tiny focus of i
	   ncreased signal within the marrow of the olecranon is likely degenerative in nat
	   ure. No osseous abscess is present. There is no elbow joint effusion. Mild degen
	   erative change involves the capitellum. Limited assessment of the insertion of t
	   he triceps tendon on the olecranon is normal. The biceps tendon inserts normally
	    on the radial tuberosity. A small amount of increased signal within the subcuta
	   neous fat overlying the medial aspect of the antecubital fossa represents mild n
	   onspecific edema. Limited assessment of the common extensor origin and common fl
	   exor origin is unremarkable. IMPRESSION:  Olecranon bursitis. No elbow joint eff
	   usion. No evidence of osseous involvement of the adjacent ulna. Mild-to-moderate
	    degenerative change involving the radiocapitellar joint..Transthoracic Echocard
	   iogram [**3272-8-1**]:Conclusions  1. The left atrium is normal in size. The lef
	   t atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately dilated.2. Left ventricula
	   r wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overa
	   ll left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed. No masses or thromb
	   i are seen in the left ventricle. Resting regional wall motion abnormalities inc
	   lude akinesis of the lower [**2-4**]'s of the LV with relative sparing of the ba
	   se. The apex is dyskinetic. The septum exhibits paradoxical motion. 3. Right ven
	   tricular chamber size is normal. There is focal hypokinesis of the apical free w
	   all of the right ventricle. 4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
	   . Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. 5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thi
	   ckened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tric

	   have Left elbow cellulitis. .In the ED, the pt was found to be febrile to 102.2,
	    pulse 92, BP 100/50, breathing comfortably on room air. The pt recieved fluid r
	   epletion with 1 L normal saline, and levofloxacin to treat cellulitis of Left ar

	   / infected calcinotic effusion:   On the [**Doctor Last Name 169**] medicine ser
	   vice, the clinical suspicion was initially high for abscess of the L forearm, gi
	   ven the tenderness, erythema, and fluctuance on physical exam, as well as the h/
	   o of yellow, prurlent drainage. The ED abx changed to clindamucin alone in order
	    to cover community acquired gram positive organisms. The fluid was confirmed by
	    sonogram, and Plastic surgery was consulted and performed I&D on [**7-27**]. Pl
	   astics reported the drainage of approximately 10 cc of yellow, purulent fluid. T
	   he clinical suspicion was low for infected joint because the pt was able to tole
	   rate both passive and active movement at the joint without discomfort. The micro
	    lab reported that the gram stain of the swab of the purulent fluid showed few P
	   MNs, no organisms. However, on HD #2, the cx revealed s. aureus. Vanc was starte
	   d to cover possible MSSA. The pt developed the SOB during the vanc infusion (as
	   described in detail above), and vanc was changed to Linezolid. The sensitivities
	    were reported over the phone on [**7-29**] as OSSA, linezolid was d/c'ed and th

	    admission, the pt was found to have a chronic iron defiency anemia, for which s
	   he has recieved multiple blood transfusions in the past. Her anemia remained sta
	   ble in the 21-24 range over the first days in the hospital. Because the anemia w
	   as severe, the pt was encouraged to accept tranfusion. The patient had one guaia
	   c positive stool during her hospital course. The pt at first refused transfusion
	   . ECG was checked because of the CAD risk factors and stress of severe anemia an
	   d infection. The ECG showed diffuse T wave inversions, and the pt has been witho
	   ut Chest pain throughout her hospital course. Cardiac enzymes were checked as de
	   tailed below.  Cardiology was consulted.  The pt agreed to transfusion on HD #2,
