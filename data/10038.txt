	    placement History of Present Illness:88 yo f with PMH of atrial fibrillation an
	   d HTN presented to the ED on [**3151-3-25**] with failure to thrive. According t
	   o patient's daughter, patient with increased fatigue and sleepiness x 2 days wit
	   h associated worsening mobility x 1 day. Patient's daughter then called the geri
	   atrics on-call attending (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 333**]) who recommended that
	    she come into the ED. Upon admission to the ED, patient had a fever to 100.1 an
	   d was given tylenol. She was given 1L NS as patient looked very dry. She was adm
	   itted to the medicine service.  .  Initially, she was noted to have low grade te
	   mps, left hip pain and leukocytosis. Given previous hip replacements, ortho was
	   consulted. Initial XR showed no fracture. Ortho recommended ultrasound of hip an
	   d US guided arthrocentesis. LENIs showed no DVT but flattening of the waveform s
	   uggsting more proximal obstruction. US hip showed mostly solid 4 cm hematoma ext
	   ending anteriorly from the femoral prosthesis to the proximal femoral diaphysis
	   with no definite signs of abscess.  .  Over the next two days, she triggered on
	   [**3-26**] for rigoring, temp to 102, and hypertension. Her abx were broadened t
	   o include vancomycin and zosyn. She triggered again on [**3-27**] for BP 79/48 a
	   nd HR 120, and was bolused with fluids with improved BP to 90's. Initial blood c
	   ultures were negative, but repeat cultures on [**3-26**] were noted to be growin
	   g 4/4 bottles with GPC's in pairs and chains. She received a total of about 1.5
	   liters of fluid on the floor. Given possibility of sepsis, she was transferred t
	   o the ICU for closer monitoring and treatment despite DNR/DNI.  .  Initial BP in
	    the MICU was 101/57and HR 100's. She has mild left hip pain, denies chest pain,
	    shortness of breath, other pain. She feels generally "unwell" but is mildly dis
	   oriented as is ber baseline by report. She is unwilling to provide further ROS.

	   ostheses with multiple chronic abnormalities as described above. No acute fractu
	   re or change in alignment.  - Left unilateral US - [**3151-3-25**] - No DVT in t
	   he imaged veins. However, flattening of the left venous waveforms suggests a mor
	   e proximal obstruction and further evaluation of the proximal vessels with CT or
	    MR is recommended.	- [**3151-3-25**] - Portable CXR - IMPRESSION: Decrease in
	   the size of the chronic right-sided pleural effusion since the prior study of Ap
	   ril	- MRI read pending  - Hip ultrasound: mostly solid 4 cm hematoma extending
	   anteriorly from the femoral prosthesis to the proximal femoral diaphysis with no
	    definite signs of abscess  .[**3-26**] MRI Pelvis: Bilateral masses with a larg
	   e intrapelvic component, larger on the right, which appear related to the joints
	   . Evaluation is suboptimal. These masses were present on the prior CT examinatio
	   n, but appear somewhat smaller in size. Hematoma is not considered likely due to
	    the chronicity. However, given the history of multiple hip replacements, the bi
	   laterallity, and the unusual appearance of these lesions, foremost consideration
	    is given to a foreign-body reaction. Less likely would be a proliferative synov
	   ial condition such as PVNS, or synovial chondromatosis. .[**3-27**] US EXTREMITY
	    NONVASCULAR LEFT LE: Findings most consistent with a hematoma extending anterio
	   rly from the femoral prosthesis to the proximal femoral diaphysis.  There are no
	    sonographic findings of an abscess, however, an element of superimposed infecti
	   on cannot be excluded. .[**3-28**]: US MULT/COMP ABSC/CYST DRAIN/I; GUIDANCE FOR
	    ABSCESS: Successful ultrasound-guided aspiration of left thigh hematoma. 5-6 cc
	    of dark red fluid was sent for Gram stain and culture.  Brief Hospital Course:8
	   8 yo f with past medical history significant for atrial fibrillation on coumadin
	   , hypertension, and s/p bilateral hip replacements who presented with lethargy a
	   nd found to have left hip hematoma now transfered to the MICU for possible sepsi
	   s from GPCs.  .   #) Sepsis:  She presented with hypotension in the setting of f
	   evers and elevated WBC count and Group-B streptococcal bacteremia c/w septic phy
	   siology.  She was admitted to the MICU and was originally started on Vancomycin/
	   Pip-Tazo on [**3-27**] however antibiotics were changed to Penicillin G when hip
	    fluid and blood cultures grew out Group B strep sensitive to penicillin.  She d
	   efervesced and BPs stabilized and she was transferred out of the unit to the gen
	   eral medicine service.  TTE was negative for vegetations.  Orthopedics was consu
	   lted who offered possible surgical intervention for removal of her hardware from
	    previous total hip replacement, however patient and her family and HCP opted ag
	   ainst surgical intervention.  Thus, she will need continued IV antibiotics (3 mi
	   llion units IV Pen G q6h) for 6-8 weeks and then will likely need oral antibioti
	   cs following IV course.  She is scheduled for follow in the infectious disease c
	   linic. .  #) Left hip hematoma with secondary infection with Group B strep and s
	   ource of GBS bacteremia.  Her pain was managed with lidoderm patch, standing tyl
	   enol and prn morphine IV.  She was noted to have had on admission a significant
	   hematocrit drop from her baseline, but her hct remained stable not requiring prb
	   c transfusion.  She did, however, receive 3U FFP on admission to the ICU as her
	   INR was supratherapeutic at that time.  Her coumadin was held, but her INR did n
	   ot adequately come down so she required PO vitamin K in order to decrease her IN
	   R.  As her hct remained stable without any signs of expanding hemotoma, orthoped
	   ics was okay with the reinitiation of coumadin for her a. fib, so it was restart
	   ed at her home dose..  #) Congestive heart failure:	On admission, she had eleva
	   ted BNP and right-sided pleural effusion.  However, she appeared intravascularly
	    dry by labs and initial exam.  She was found to be in acute renal failure on pr
	   esentation thought [**2-16**] to prerenal etiology so her diuretics were held.
	   Echocardiogram revealed moderate LVH with preserved LV systolic function, mild a
	   ortic regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hy
	   pertension.	Upon transfer to the floor, however, she had persistent supplementa
	   l oxygen requirement and crackles on pulmonary exam.  As her renal function had
	   improved, diuresis was reinitiated and at time of discharge, she was maintaining
	    O2 saturation on room air.	She will be discharged on home dose lasix and lisin
	   opril. .  #) Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine was elevated to 1.9 intitially, wit
	   h baseline 0.9-1.1.	This was thought most likely secondary to pre-renal etiolog
	   y possibly secondary to septic physiology and ATN in the setting of hypotension
	   on presentation.  Her ACEI and lasix were held and her renal function normalized
	   .  Her lasix was restarted and her renal function remained stable.  Her ACEI was
	    then restarted with renal function remaining stable at her baseline..#) Atrial
	   Fibrillation:  On chronic anticoagulation as an outpatient, however INR was 4 up
	   on admission.  Her coumadin was held, but her INR did not adequately come down l
	   ikely secondary to dietary vitamin K deficiency so she received additional PO vi
	   tamin K with good response of her INR.  She does have significant risk of thromb
	   oembolic event based on her CHADS score, so hct remained stable without evidence
	    of expanding hematoma when cleared by orthopedics for reinitiation, she was res
	   tarted on her home dose of coumadin.  INR at time of discharge was 1.9.  Additio
	   nally, she was continued on diltiazem for rate control.  .  #) Elevated blood su
	   gar:  Although she has no clear documented history of diabetes mellitus and was
	   not on any oral medications upon admission, her blood sugar remained elevated du
	   ring her entire stay.  She was placed on insulin sliding scale while inpatient w
	   ith goal for tight control in the setting of her infection.	This will need to b
	   e continued upon discharge and further management evaluated by her primary care
	   physician upon follow up..#) Hypertension:  Although she orinally presented hypo
	   tensive, treatment of her infection improved her blood pressure.  Her lasix and
	   ACEI were originally held, but were restarted with improvement in her renal func
	   tion and increase in her blood pressure..#) Dementia:  She was continued on Aric
	   ept 5mg PO daily.  .  #) Osteoporosis:  She was continued on calcium and Vitamin
