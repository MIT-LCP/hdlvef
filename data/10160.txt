	   r. [**Known patient firstname **] [**Known patient lastname 1113**] is an86-year
	   -old gentleman with a history of coronary arterydisease status post coronary art
	   ery bypass graft, congestiveheart failure with an ejection fraction in the 30% r
	   ange,atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, chronic renal insufficiency,hepatitis C, l
	   iver cirrhosis, who presented to the MedicalIntensive Care Unit with fever and h
	   ypotension on [**3186-7-9**].The patient was transfused at the [**Hospital6 1114
	   **] approximately two days prior to admission forchronic anemia of uncertain eti
	   ology, according to thepatient's family.  The day following transfusion, the pat
	   ientwas in his usual state of health.  The morning of admission,at 1 A.M., the p
	   atient began to have rigors and a fever athome.  The patient's family describes
	   a fever to 38.5 degreesCelsius in the early morning hours.  The patient denied c
	   hestpain, shortness of breath, cough, dysuria, nausea, vomiting,diarrhea.  He ha
	   s chronic abdominal pain.  It was unclearwhether there were any changes in this
	   abdominal pain.Additionally, the patient did not complain of headache orneck sti
	   ffness.In the [**Hospital1 10**] Emergency Room,the patient was afebrile and ini
	   tially had a blood pressurein the 110 range, but became progressively hypotensiv
	   e with asystolic blood pressure in the 80s, as well as a temperaturespike to 102
	    degrees Farenheit, and oxygen saturation in the90s.On physical examination in t
	   he Emergency Room, there wasnoted to be right upper quadrant as well as left low
	   erquadrant tenderness without rebound or guarding.  It wasunclear in discussion
	   with the patient's family whether thiswas actually a change for him.  The patien
	   t was noted to havea white count of 17.8, with a left shift and 1 band form.The
	   chest x-ray, urinalysis and blood cultures wereperformed.  Chest x-ray failed to
	    demonstrate infiltrates.Urinalysis demonstrated evidence of urinary tract infec
	   tion.The patient was given ampicillin, levofloxacin and Flagyl.The patient's dau
	   ghter, acting as his health care proxy,refused further workup including CT scan
	   and lumbar puncturein the Emergency Room.  Additionally, the patient's familyref
	   used central venous access.	Therefore, in the EmergencyRoom, the patient was be
	   gun on dopamine via peripheralintravenous lines and was transferred to the Inten
	   sive CareUnit.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:	Coronary artery disease status postcoronary
	    artery bypass graft in 5/01, ejection fractiondepressed in the 30 to 35% range,

	   HYSICAL EXAMINATION:   At the time of admission, temperaturewas 92.0, heart rate
	    72, blood pressure 107/42 on 5 mcg ofdopamine, respiratory rate 22, oxygen satu
	   ration 92 to 93% onroom air.  In general, an elderly male in distress.  Theoroph
	   arynx was noted to be dry. The lungs were clear.  Theleft radial pulse was decre
	   ased. The right radial pulse wasregular.  The cardiac examination revealed a dis
	   tant cardiacexamination with a normal S1 and S2, a II/VI holosystolicmurmur at t
	   he apex.  Present bowel sounds and an abdominalexamination notable for wincing a
	   nd grimacing with palpationin the right upper quadrant but otherwise non-rigid a
	   bdomen,nondistended abdomen.  There was no peripheral edema.  Theneck was noted
	   to be supple.  The patient was followingcommands of his daughter.  He was alert,
	    moving all fourextremities equally.  He was noted to have bibasilarcrackles, ap
	   proximately one-quarter of the way up, otherwiseclear to auscultation bilaterall
	   y.  Please note that thepatient's blood pressure on the initial examination byMe
	   dicine in the Emergency Room had a blood pressure in the80s/40s.DATA:  White blo
	   od count at the time of admission was 17.8,hematocrit 29.8, with a differential
	   on the initial whitecount of 94% neutrophils, 1% bands, 2% lymphocytes, 2%monocy
	   tes, 1% atypical cells. A repeat differential on [**3186-7-10**]at 3:40 A.M. dem
	   onstrated 80% neutrophils, 15% bands, 1%lymphocytes, 3% monocytes, as well as 1%
	    metas.  A plateletcount at admission was 185, with a PT of 20.3 and an INR of2.
	   9, a PTT of 41.8.  Urine at the time of admission wasnegative for urinary tract
	   infection.  A Chem 7 at the timeof admission revealed a sodium of 137, potassium
	    4.6,chloride 103, bicarbonate 19, BUN 57, creatinine 2.2, glucose84.  ALT was 4
	   8, AST 59, LDH 271, CK 27 and flat for thisadmission.  Alkaline phosphatase was
	   274, amylase 131, totalbilirubin 1.1, lipase 24, troponin less than 0.3 on multi
	   plemeasures.  Calcium was 8.2, phos 2.5, magnesium 1.6.  Albuminwas 3.0.  A free
	    calcium 67 was 1.12.  Blood cultures from[**3186-7-15**] demonstrate no growth
	   to date. Blood cultures from[**3186-7-9**] demonstrate staphylococcus aureus coa
	   g-positive,sensitive to oxacillin in four out of four bottles.  A sputumfrom [**
	   3186-7-10**] was felt to be contaminated.  Urine culturedemonstrated less than 1
	   0,000 organisms.RADIOLOGIC DATA:  Chest x-ray from [**3186-7-9**] demonstrated n
	   odefined consolidation.  A PA and lateral from the same datedemonstrated interva
	   l increase in size of bilateral pleuraleffusions, incidental note made of degene
	   rative change in theright shoulder.	A repeat chest x-ray of [**3186-7-10**] dem
	   onstratedfindings consistent with asymmetric pulmonary edema.  A CTscan performe
	   d on [**3186-7-10**] of the abdomen and pelvisdemonstrated the following:  Bilat
	   eral pleural effusions,right greater than left, with a small right subpulmonicco
	   mponent, bibasilar partial collapse, consolidation, rightgreater than left, low
	   attenuation of focus in the superioraspect of the right lobe of the liver.  Eval
	   uation is limitedby lack of intravenous contrast, small amounts of free fluidwit
	   hin the pelvis.  There is fluid and stranding within theright pericolic gutter.
	    No abdominal pathology isidentified. A right upper quadrant ultrasound performe
	   d[**3186-7-10**] demonstrates cholelithiasis without evidence for acutecholecyst
	   itis, as well as question of liver echotexture andsolitary well-defined mass wit
	   hin the right hepatic lobe,consistent with the patient's history of cirrhosis an
	   d knownhepatic mass.  Electrocardiogram from [**3186-7-9**] was read asfollows:
	    Atrial fibrillation, intraventricular conductiondefect, inferior infarct age un
	   determined.CARDIOLOGY DATA:	Echocardiogram performed on [**3186-7-10**]demonstr
	   ated the following:	The left atrium is mildlydilated.  Left ventricular cavity
	   is mildly dilated.  Overallleft ventricular systolic function difficult to asses
	   s, butprobably moderately depressed.  Posterolateral and apicalhypokinesis was p
	   resent.  The aortic valve leaflets aremildly thickened.  Mitral valve leaflets a
	   re mildlythickened.	Moderate 2+ mitral regurgitation is seen.  Due toshadowing,
	    the severity of mitral regurgitation might besignificantly underestimated.	Mod
	   erate 2+ tricuspidregurgitation is seen.  There is moderate pulmonary arterysyst
	   olic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.(Vegetations were not commen
	   ted on.)HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:1.  Infectious Disease:  The patient, as state
	   d above, wasadmitted with hypotension and fever, felt to be consistentwith sepsi
	   s.  The patient was originally covered broadly withampicillin and gentamicin in
	   the Emergency Room.	To thisregimen, levofloxacin was added.  Ultimately the pat
	   ient'sblood cultures revealed gram-positive cocci, later identifiedas staphyloco
	   ccus aureus coag-positive, and the patient wasbegun on vancomycin for the possib
	   ility of resistantorganisms, however, this was changed to oxacillin rapidly asse
	   nsitivities became available.  To date, the patient has oneset of blood cultures
	    which has demonstrated no growth todate.  The patient's transthoracic echocardi
	   ogram was done torule out the possibility of endocarditis, given the patient'shi
	   story of abnormal valvular morphology as well as recentstaphylococcal bacteremia
	   .  The patient's family, though theyappeared to understand the risks and benefit
	   s which weredescribed to them of transesophageal echocardiogram,repeatedly refus
	   ed to undergo this procedure.  The patient'sfamily refused lumbar puncture in th
	   e Emergency Room, whichwas requested by a physician from the Emergency Room give
	   nthe patient's question of mental status and fever.Ultimately, secondary to conc
	   erns surrounding the patient'sobvious right upper quadrant tenderness, it was su
	   ggestedthat the patient go for a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis.The patient's
	    family rejected this suggestion in theEmergency Room, but later were more willi
	   ng to consider thepossibility of abdominal CT, which the patient underwent on[**
	   3186-7-10**].  This study was performed to rule out intra-abdominalsource of sep
	   sis.  With the patient's initial picture offever and hypotension, he was assumed
	    to have sepsissecondary to staphylococcus aureus of unknown etiology.  Thepatie
	   nt rapidly defervesced, and maintained a blood pressurewithin the normal range o
	   n antibiosis, principally vancomycinand then oxacillin, other antibiotics having
	    beendiscontinued when culture data returned.Given the fact that the patient's f
	   amily refusedtransesophageal echocardiography, and given the fact thatdiscussion
	   s with Cardiology led to a suggestion fortransesophageal echocardiography to fur
	   ther assess forpresence of endocarditis, a decision was made to treat thepatient
	    as if he did indeed have staphylococcal endocarditis,as the patient's family re
	   peated refused measures, includingtransesophageal echocardiogram, to assess for
	   the presence ofsaid infection.  The current plan is to treat the patientwith oxa
	   cillin intravenously for the continuance of a sixweek course.2.  Cardiovascular:
	     The patient was known to have a historyof tricuspid as well as mitral regurgit
	   ation by anechocardiogram in [**3185**].  The patient was again sent forechocard
	   iography, with a fairly limited study which did notmention in the official repor
	   t the presence or absence ofvalvular vegetations.  In discussing this study with
	    theCardiology fellow decided that the safest course of actionwas to pursue tran
	   sesophageal echocardiogram to rule out thepossibility of endocarditis in this ge
	   ntleman.  The patient'sfamily refused transesophageal echocardiogram, although t
	   herisks and benefits of this procedure were described to them.The patient was ru
	   led out for myocardial infarction.The patient was initially maintained on periph
	   eral dopaminefor pressor support, as the patient's family refused centralaccess,
	    although the risk of peripheral necrosis or otherrisks of peripheral administra
	   tion of dopamine or otherpressors were repeatedly explained to them.  The patien
	   t'sfamily nonetheless refused to allow the patient to havecentral access establi
	   shed.Echocardiography was repeated during the course of thisadmission, with a tr
	   ansthoracic echocardiogram with theabove-noted results.  His antihypertensive me
	   dications wereinitially held at admission, and then restarted prior to thetime o
	   f his impending discharge.The patient has a history of congestive heart failure
	   with afurther history of a low ejection fraction.  Lasix wasinitially withheld f
	   rom the patient as he was admitted in astate of hypotension.  By the time of dis
	   charge, however, thepatient had been restarted on his outpatient dose of lasix.E
	   xamination of the patient's lung fields was often difficultgiven the patient's r
	   efusal to breathe quietly, even throughtranslation, preferring rather to speak l
	   oudly with his wifeduring the course of pulmonary examination.  However, thepati
	   ent was noted to have stable pulse oxygenation throughoutthe course of this admi
	   ssion, with no episodes of flashpulmonary edema or other concerning pulmonary ev
	   ents to thecurrent date.3.  Renal:  The patient's creatinine was noted to beappr
	   oximately at his baseline.  Attempts were made to renallydose medications.4.  He
	   matology:  The patient does admit to chronic anemia ofunknown etiology, for whic
	   h it is believed he has beenfollowing at the [**Hospital6 1116**], but haseviden
	   tly refused any invasive workup at that institution,including bone marrow biopsy
	   .5.	Gastrointestinal:  The patient has a history of hepatitisC, with evidence f
	   or cirrhosis on imaging, as well as astable hepatic mass.6.	Access:  The patien
	   t's family repeated refused centralaccess, although at one point they did consen
	   t to centralline placement.	The patient's family later rescinded thisdecision.
	    The patient was maintained on peripheralintravenous lines through the course of
	    his stay, withrecognition by the medical care team that this represents asubopt
	   imal situation, especially initially in a patient whowas septic with low blood p
	   ressures on pressor support.  Therisks of continuing without central access were
	    repeatedlydescribed to the patient's family, who appeared to understandthese ri
	   sks, but refused central access.  At the currenttime, the plan is for placement
	   of PICC access for long-termantibiosis at the time of impending discharge from t
	   hehospital.	Today, [**3186-7-15**], the patient's wife has for asecond time ref
	   used PICC placement, notwithstanding therepeated discussion with the medical tea
	   m regarding thepatient's need for long-term antibiosis.CODE STATUS:	The patient
	   's family, while stating that theydid not want the patient to undergo transesoph
	   agealechocardiography, central venous access for pressor supportduring the perio
	   d of hypotension and sepsis, or other testingincluding initially CT scan, did st
	   ate that they would likeall possible measures to be taken to revive the patients
	   hould he stop breathing or cease to have a pulse.COMMUNICATION:  The [**Hospital
	    101**] medical care team experiencesome difficulty in communication with the pa
	   tient, who speaksa very limited amount of English.  The patient's family,includi
	   ng the patient's daughter and wife, speak English andwere often noted to refuse
	   certain aspects of the care of thepatient for reasons that were often unclear; f
	   or instance,the patient's wife has refused PICC placement today because,in her w
	   ords, the patient has "a fever," although histemperature has repeatedly been mea
	   sured at 98.5 by nursingstaff today.MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF THIS DISCHARGE SU
	   MMARY:  Oxacillin2 grams intravenously every four hours to be continued forthe r
	   emainder of a five week course to complete a total ofsix weeks of antibiosis (gi
	   ven the patient's and thepatient's family's insistence of avoidance of transesop
	   hagealechocardiogram), Protonix 40 mg by mouth once daily, Colace100 mg by mouth
	    twice a day, Zestril 2.5 mg by mouth oncedaily, Tums, vitamin D, Coumadin 3 mg
	   by mouth daily atbedtime, Lopressor 12.5 mg by mouth twice a day (this is thedos
	   e which the patient's family insists upon, as it wasevidently his outpatient dos
	   e).DISCHARGE PLAN:  At the current time, the discharge plan isstill currently in
	    some state of flux, however, it is plannedthat the patient will be treated with
	    intravenous antibioticsfor a total of a six week course, given his and his fami
	   ly'srefusal to fully evaluate the patient for the possibility ofstaphylococcal e
	   ndocarditis.CONDITION AT THE TIME OF THIS DISCHARGE SUMMARY:  Stable.DIAGNOSES T
