	    Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:thoracentesis (left) History of Present Il
	   lness:67 yo m w/ h/o squamous cell ca of the lung s/p stenting of the L main ste
	   m bronchus at [**Hospital6 2435**], who initially presented to an OSH on [**2896
	   -7-24**] with an acute GI bleed.  Prior to his presentation, he had been at a [*
	   *Hospital1 **] receiving Vanc and Zosyn since [**7-19**] for pneumonia.  In OSH
	   ED, pt unresponsive (VS unknown), noted to be in respiratory distress with a sat
	    of 77%.  Labs were significant for wbc 22k, Hct 10, K 6.0, Bicarb 10, INR 10 (f
	   elt secondary to coumadin in combination with antibitotics and amiodarone).	He
	   was given 5 units PRBC's, 2 units FFP, and intubated for metabolic acidosis and
	   airway protection in the setting of acute blood loss anemia and a GI bleed.	He
	   was then transferred to the ICU for further management.  .During his MICU course
	   , he had an EGD showing multiple small duodenal ulcerations without adherent clo
	   t.  He was given an additional 2 units of PRBCs in the ICU, and did not have sig
	   ns of active bleeding throughout the remainder of his hospital course.   Later a
	   n attempt was made to wean him from the vent. The patient was changed to pressur
	   e support, and he did not tolerate this, so he was placed back on assist control
	   .  Pulmonary was consulted and performed a bronchoscopy, which revealed complete
	    occlusion of the left mainstem bronchus, as well as secretions and mucus plugs
	   in the right lung, which were cleaned out and sent for culture.  For his ongoing
	    fevers, vancomycin and zosyn were continued for presumed post-obstructive pneum
	   onia.  Stool cultures were positive for C. diff, so he was also started on PO Fl
	   agyl.  Apparently, the patient also had 1/2 blood cultures positive for VRE; how
	   ever, this was believed to be a contaminent so linezolid was not started.  In ad
	   dition to these issues, the patient also had an episode of rapid A fib which req
	   uired IV lopressor and amiodarone.  He was also in acute renal failure, thought
	   to be ATN secondary to hypotension on presentation..The patient was transferred
	   to the ICU at [**Hospital1 19**] for possible stenting of his left main stem bro
	   nchus.  On admission to the ICU, he was hypotensive with SBP in the mid-80's.  H
	   e was given IVF NS bolus x 1 liter, but BP did not respond.	He was started on l
	   evophed and an a-line was placed.  Given his h/o mass compressing the LA, emerge
	   nt bedside TTE was done, which showed a normal EF without evidence of tamponade.
	     Bronchoscopy was performed which revealed 95% occlusion of the left mainstem b
	   ronchus by extrinsic tumor.	Secretions were sent for culture. Past Medical Hist
	   ory:- Left lung squamous cell carcinoma: diagnosed in [**2895-10-7**]; s/p stent
	   ing to the left mainstem bronchus because of occulsion, as well as radiation the
	   rapy.  Tumor expanded through XRT, and he has needed several laser treatments fo
	   r reocclusion of the left mainstem bronchus. He was also recently started on che
	   motherapy (Tarceva). - Post-obstructive pneumonia- A Fib (on coumadin): with sev
	   eral episodes of RVR, requiring cardioversion on one occasion.  Now on amiodaron
	   e.- compression of the left atrium (? tumor vs. LAD)- transfusion dependent anem
	   ia - hypertension.	     Social History:Prior to this hospitalization, the pati
	   ent was at High Gate Manor Nursing Home. He was previously living at home with h
	   is family.  His son, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern
	   1) 2436**], is his health care proxy ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2437**]).  Currenlty,
	    the patient's Code Status is full.	Apparently, the patient had a conversation
	   with his PCP several days prior to admission, at which point said that he wanted
	    to be DNR/DNI.  The family reversed this code status on this admission to the O
	   SH, as they felt that the patient was confused at the time he made the decision
	   to be DNR/DNI.  By report from the daughter, the patient has a wife who he has n
	   ot been living with for many years.	He has had a girlfriend for 30+ years.	Fam

	   squamous cell ca of the lung s/p stenting of the L main stem bronchus, who initi
	   ally presented to an OSH on [**2896-7-24**] with an acute GI bleed, now transfer
	   red from OSH for possible stenting of left mainstem bronchus occlusion..1) SHOCK
	   /HYPOTENSION: patient hypotesnive on arrival.  warm extremities, low grade fever
	   , and recent respiratory failure point to septic shock as etiology.	Other possi
	   bility includes hypovolemia from GIB, however, Hct stable and no evidence of blo
	   od loss.  Potential sources of infection include post-obstructive pneumonia (mos
	   t likely), C. diff, line infection, or hepatobiliary source (elevated LFTs, but
	   more likely [**2-8**] to hypotension).  patient also with VRE on blood cx's at O
	   SH, but thought to be contamination, so not covered with abx. Replaced vanco wit
	   h linezolid, continued Zosyn and Flagyl. Bolused w/ IVF to keep CVP 10-12, MAP>6
	   0. Pt required Levophed to maintain MAP > 60..2) RESPIRATORY FAILURE: patient wa
	   s intubated at OSH for airway protection and respiratory failure due to acidosis
	   .  Resp failure likely multifactorial: left mainstem obstruction, pneumonia, and
	    acidosis. Pt was not bronched and stented [**8-1**] because it was felt he was
	   too unstable for the procedure. Pt underwent thoracentesis of left lung [**8-1**
	   ], 2+ liters fluid removed, pleural fluid transudative by LDH (fluid to serum ra
	   tio 0.55)..3) GI BLEED: patient presented to OSH with acute GIB, Hct=10 on prese
	   ntation in setting of supertherapeutic INR.	EGD at OSH showing duodenal ulcers.
	     s/p 7 units PRBCs and 2 units FFP.  No further bleeding and Hct stabilized in
	   low 30's..4) FEVER/LEUKOCYTOSIS:  as described above, patient febrile on present
	   ation to OSH.  also with WBC = 22.  Potential sources of infection described abo
	   ve, include post-obstructive pneumonia, C. diff, line infection, or hepatobiliar
	   y source (elevated LFTs, but more likely [**2-8**] to hypotension).	In addtion,
	    VRE on blood cx's at OSH, but thought to be contamination, so not covered with
	   abx.- Zosyn continued for ?post-obstructive pneumonia, will Linezolid started in
	   stead of vanco to cover resp organisms, as well as VRE bacteremia.- PO flagyl co
	   ntinued for C. diff.5) NON-GAP METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: unclear etiology. ?hyperchlor
	   emic from aggressive IVF at OSH vs. diarrhea.  - given D5 w/ 2 amps bicarb.6) AR
	   F: patient also with ARF, likely [**2-8**] to ATN from hypotension on arrival to
	    OSH.  - all meds renally dosed.7) A FIB: pt has h/o A fib with RVR requiring ca
	   rdioversion in the past.  mass compressing LA likely contributing. - Amiodarone
	   400 mg PO TID continued- lopressor, coumadin held since hypotensive and recent G
	   IB.8) TRANSAMINITIS: elevated LFTs, ?secondary to shock liver given recent hypot
	   ension.  cholestatic picture, so also concerning for hepatobilliary obstruction.
	   - RUQ U/S [**7-31**] showed no cholelithiasis or cholecystitis; also an echogeni
	   c mass in regional of right adrenal gland but unclear whether it originated from
	    adrenal gland or liver itself.9) FEN: was receiving TF's at OSH.- IVF w/ bicarb
	    as above.10) PPx: pneumoboots (no SC heparin given recent bleed), PPI..11) ACCE
	   SS: R IJ (placed [**7-25**] @ OSH).12) Communication: HCP is son, [**Doctor Firs
	   t Name **]On [**8-2**], a family discussion was held including children and heal
	   thcare proxy.  Medical condition was updated and all questions were answered.  A
	   ll agreed that the patient clearly stated he did not want intubation and clearly
	    expressed the desire for DNR/DNI.  Recognizing the advanced stages of malignanc
	   y and progression despite attempted treatments, the decision was made to focus o
	   n comfort.  Patient was extubated and expired.  Family was present.	Pt. expired
