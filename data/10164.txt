	   2. Unchanged appearance of the chest, with a persistent small air collection com
	   municating with the posterior chest wall on the right with small bilateral pleur
	   al effusions with possible loculation on the right. Brief Hospital Course:Pt was
	    admitted on date of surgery for repair of bronchopleural fistula that developed
	    after lobe resection in July of 04. She tolerated the procedure well and was tr
	   ansferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for recovery. She was maintained o
	   n levofloxacin, metronidazole, and fluconazole for coverage of fistula. AGgressi
	   ve wound packing was maintained along with mechanical ventilation. Based on cult
	   ure data, the fluconazole was discontinued on [**12-26**]. Pt was tried on Passy
	   -Muir valve on the 22nd, but was noted to have only weak voice with the valve. R
	   emaining antibiotics were discontinued on [**12-27**]. Pt began trach mask trial
	   s on [**12-28**], with some success. Open wound debridements began on [**1-4**],
	    with resection of a small amount of necrotic tissue, and visualization of the f
	   istula. Per Infectious disease service pt was started on vanco based on culture
	   data from wound. AS of 12/8, pt continued to have occasional runs of afib, and h
	   er metoprolol was increased in response to this. Began re-entering cholecystosto
	   my output into J-tube to prevent excess loss of bile acids. Pt gradually recover
	   ed ability to take food by mouth, and began requiring less tube feed support. By
	    [**1-21**] pt was doing well, with well-healing wound, and deemed a suitable ca
	   ndidate for a rehabilitation facility to optimize her functional status. She has
	    excellent rehabilitation potential for speech, ambulation, and eventual closure
