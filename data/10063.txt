	   story of Present Illness:60 y/o African American female with no significant past
	    medical history who presented the evening of 8/1 with a two day history of feve
	   r, lethargy, nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Patient reported weight loss
	   of 30 lbs., polyuria, polydipsia, blurry vision, headache, and fatigue over the
	   course of the last few months prior to admission. At the time of admission to th
	   e emergency department, she was found to have a temperature of 104.9, WBC of 180
	   00 with bandemia, glucose>400 with AG 20, systolic BPs in 160s, tachycardia, and
	    lethargy. In the ED, she was given ceftriaxone, flagyl, and vancomycin and a 10
	    units IV insulin bolus followed by an insulin drip which was started initially
	   at 5 units/hour and tapered down to 3 units, and then discontinued around 11 pm
	   at which time her anion gap had closed and her acidosis had resolved. She was st
	   arted on RSSI and her blood sugars were closely monitored along with her serum e
	   lectrolytes, Mg2+, and P. Patient underwent CXR which was negative. She also had
	    blood cultures x 2, urine cultures, and U/A done at that time as well. A CT of
	   the abdomen/pelvis was performed and did not reveal any intraabdominal source of
	    infection that could be accounting for her presumed DKA/new onset DM. Because p
	   atient was lethargic at time of presentation, she also underwent head CT which d
	   id not reveal cerebral edema or intracranial hemorrhage. She subsequently underw
	   ent LP and was then brought to the FICU. Patient denied any previous diagnosis o
	   f DM and any medical problems apart from a recent pharyngitis in the recent past
	   . It is unclear if she has seen a medical doctor in the last three years. Past M

	   Pertinent studies:CT-Head [**9-6**]: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or e
	   dema. Of note, meningitis is not excluded on the basis of this study. CT-Abdomen
	    [**9-6**]: Unremarkable CT of the abdomen and pelvis. No intra-abdominal source
	    for the patient's fever is identified. CXR from [**9-7**] was read to be within
	    normal limits.TTE [**9-8**] demonstrated normal left ventricular wall thickness
	   , cavity size, and systolic function with LVEF > 55%; normal left ventricular wa
	   ll motion. TEE was deferred for now as the suspicion of a para- or retropharynge
	   al/ epidural abscess was high.MRI neck [**9-9**]: No evidence of retropharyngeal
	    or peritonsillar fluid collection or abscess. TEE [**9-14**]: The left atrium i
	   s normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left v
	   entricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>5
	   5%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are s
	   imple atheroma in the ascending aorta and in the aortic arch. The aortic valve l
	   eaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
	    regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The mitra
	   l valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass o
	   r vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. There is a small pericardial effusion.
	     RLE u/s: Normal flow, augmentation, compressibility and waveforms are demonstr
	   ated. No intraluminal thrombus is identified. Brief Hospital Course:Assessment:
	   60yo woman with no known PMH presented with abdominal sx (pain, diarrhea, vomiti
	   ng) and fever, constitutional sx, found to have DM and group A strep bacteremia.
	   Hospital course is detailed below by problem:1. Hyperglycemia/presumed DKA/new o
	   nset DM - Although the patient had no prior history, she has a strong family his
	   tory and presented w/ diarrhea, hypovolemia, FS 400, ketonuria, and glucosuria.
	   She most likely had previously poor control of her blood glucose with deteriorat
	   ion in the setting of an acute infection. HbA1C was 13.4. In the ICU, she was be
	   gun on Glargine and sliding scale insulin. She was changed to metformin, as she
	   was not thought to be able to give herself insulin every day, and had a good res
	   ponse. She was also begun on an ACE-I. Her medication regimen will likely need t
	   o be further addressed as an outpatient when her infection has cleared. In the h
	   ospital, she received teaching about the diabetic diet and blood glucose monitor
	   ing. Her daughter has diabetes and expressed that she would help her mother with
	    her fingersticks. 2. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus bacteremia - During t
	   he hospitalization, the patient was found to have blood cultures positive for gr
	   oup A strep bacteremia. This was treated with PCN G IV 4MU q4h. Given the bacter
	   emia, TTE and TEE were done and showed no evidence of endocarditis. It was somew
	   hat surprising that the patient continued to have leukocytosis despite adequate
	   IV antibiotics, with a peak WBC of 21.8. Further studies, however, including the
	    TEE, a neck MRI, CXR, and multiple cultures, did not show any evidence of absce
	   ss, malignancy, or other untreated infection. By discharge, the WBC had fallen t
	   o 13. In addition, the patient had no further complaints and better glycemic con
	   trol. 3. Metabolic Syndrome - The patient fits [**3-13**] criteria : increased F
	   BG and central obesity. Blood pressures were stable throughout the course of her
	    hospital stay, lipid panel was checked and was within normal limits with the ex
	   ception of a decreased HDL. She should be encouraged to follow a good diet and e
	   xercise regularly. She was started on ASA for prophylaxis of MI/stroke given mul
	   tiple risk factors, including DM and obesity.4. Hypokalemia/Hypomagnesemia/Hypop
	   hosphatemia/Hypocalcemia - On admission, the patient was noted to have significa
	   nt electrolyte abnormalities. These were most likely due to DKA and GI loss, and
	    resolved throughout her hospitalization.5. Abdominal complaints - These were mo
	   st likely a result of the patient's DKA, all stool studies were negative. the sy
	   mptoms resolved early in the admission. Due to guaiac+ emesis, she had an NG tub
	   e placed. This was removed without complication; in fact, she noted resolution o
	   f her throat pain with removal of the NGT. 6. Mild anemia with decreased MCV - D
	   uring the hospitalization, the patient was noted to have anemia. A guaiac positi
	   ve emesis was thought to be secondary to inflammation and irritation from NGT pl
	   acement. Her stools were guaiac negative on discharge. Her Hct slowly trended do
	   wn over the course of the hospitalization, though it seemed to remain stable dur
	   ing the last several days. It was thought that this was mostly secondary to hemo
	   dilution, as the patient had no acute source of bleeding. Iron studies showed a
	   pattern suggestive of anemia of chronic disease, the underlying cause was not kn
	   own, but may have been poorly controlled diabetes.7. Thrombocytopenia - While in
	    the ICU, the patient's platelets trended downward  with a low of 104. Subsequen
	   tly, she had resolution without intervention, with her platelets on discharge st
	   able in the 200s.8. Altered mental status - Initially, this was likely secondary
	    to DKA and infection. CSF cultures were negative, head CT was negative. When th
	   e acute issues were resolved, however, it became clear that the patient also had
	    an underlying low cognitive function, most likely a lifelong issue. This can be
	    addressed as an outpatient9. Sore throat - During the hospitalization, the pati
	   ent began complaining of pain in her throat/neck. An MRI was done to rule out ab
	   scess. Upon further inspection, it was determined that the cause of her pain was
	    irritation from the NG tube, so it was discontinued. At this time, the patient
	   did not have any problems tolerating [**Name2 (NI) **] intake. Medications on Ad
