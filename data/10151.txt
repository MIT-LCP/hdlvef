	   ospital Course:The patient was admitted and diagnosed with acute promyelocytic l
	   eukemia. During the first days of her hospitalization, she developed DIC, requir
	   ing blood product support.  Shortly after starting chemotherapy she had transami
	   nitis which resolved but required decreased dosing of chemotherapy early in the
	   course. The hospitalization was complicated by an episode of hematuria followed
	   by acute abdominal pain.  CT at the time showed right hydronephrosis and hydrour
	   eter with some pelvic fluid and suggestion of right renal forniceal rupture, lik
	   ely due to a recently passed stone, clot, or sludge.  This resolved without inte
	   rvention and follow up CT showed hydronephrosis was resolving.  The patient deve
	   loped recurrent fevers approximately day 15 and was treated empirically with cef
	   epime, ambisome, vancomycin, and acyclovir.	After developing a drug rash, cefep
	   ime was discontinued and the rash resolved.	Around the time of rash, Mrs. [**Kn
	   own patient lastname 1054**] also developed raised erythematous papules on her w
	   rists and palms which dermatology biopsied and determined to be part of the drug
	    reaction.  Work up of fever included ultrasound of former LUE PICC site, CT of
	   chest, sinus, abdomen/pelvis, MRI of abdomen, TTE, TEE, and multiple blood and u
	   rine cultures - all were negative.  It was therefore determined that the fevers
	   were a reaction to ATRA.  Antibiotics were dicontinued, followed by Ambisome aft
	   er a negative liver MRI, and Mrs. [**Known patient lastname 1054**] was treated
	   with Decadron for the ATRA reaction.  Fevers resolved and Mrs. [**Known patient
	   lastname 1054**] was discharged home to continue her treatment. Medications on A
