	   SENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 44 year oldfemale with endstage liver disease se
	   condary to alcoholiccirrhosis and hepatitis B virus. The patient was on thetrans
	   plant list for liver transplantation. This was performed[**3377-6-13**], which w
	   ill be detailed below.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:	Pulmonary hypertension, peptic ulce
	   rdisease, history of an appendectomy, history of atonsillectomy and as above.MED
	   ICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Metoprolol 12.5 mg daily, Protonix40 mg daily, Lasix 80
	   mg q.a.m. and Lasix 40 mg q.p.m.,lactulose 30 cc q.i.d., spironolactone 50 mg p.
	   o. daily,sildenafil.HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was brought to the operatingro
	   om on [**6-13**], and had a piggy back liver transplantationperformed. The malat
	   e score at transplantation was 23. Thepatient was brought to the intensive care
	   unit for hercritical care. Ultrasound on postoperative day 1 revealed nointrahep
	   atic diastolic flow. It was decided at this time totake the patient back to the
	   operating room [**6-15**], forunkinking of the hepatic artery with a pexy. Liver
	    biopsy wasalso performed which showed hemorrhagic ischemic injury.Prior to this
	    and around this time, the patient hadpersistently elevated pulmonary artery pre
	   ssures and elevatedLFTs. There was no response to magic oxide or prostacycline.O
	   n [**6-16**], the patient had an angiography performed whichrevealed a lesion of
	    the celiac trunk and this was stented. Afollow-up duplex showed good diastolic
	   flow in the hepaticartery. Due to some difficulty in the mental status, a headCT
	    was obtained and these results were negative on [**6-20**].An echocardiogram wa
	   s performed which revealed an ejectionfraction on [**6-24**], of 55%. Multiple c
	   ultures were sentwhich revealed MRSA in the blood and gram negative rods inthe s
	   putum. Since the LFTs began rising again, repeatangiography revealed potential s
	   plenic resteal syndrome andthe splenic artery was coiled. This was done on [**6-
	   26**].Occasional desaturations led to obtaining VQ scans which werelow probabili
	   ty on [**6-27**]. Abdominal CT scan revealedinfarcted spleen on [**6-30**], incl
	   uding significant amount ofascites. Multiple paracenteses were performed for the
	   rapeuticpurposes as ascites began to reaccumulate. The patient wasstarted on mul
	   tiple antibiotics throughout the admissionincluding vancomycin, Zosyn, fluconazo
	   le. Immunosuppressionthroughout the admission remained CellCept, appropriate Sol
	   u-Medrol was on taper and FK506 dosed by level. The patientremained stable until
	    LFTs again began rising. An ERCP wasdone on [**7-11**], which reveals slight an
	   astomotic strictureand a stent was placed here. Repeated hepatic ultrasoundsreve
	   aled lower indices in the liver each subsequent time. Thepatient had a percutane
	   ous tracheostomy done on [**7-15**]. On[**7-17**], she had a significant increas
	   e in the LFTs to4,522 which was AST and 2,070 which was ALT. Alkalinephosphatase
	    subsequently rose to 1,074. Bilirubin remainedelevated throughout for a greater
	    portion of the admission inthe 30s and 40s range. INR on [**7-17**], was also 4
	   .8 whichis drastically increased. Ultrasound done on [**6-16**],revealed no intr
	   ahepatic arterial filling and very poorportal venous flow. The patient's status
	   significantlydeteriorated. At this point, the patient was receivingmultiple bloo
	   d products including packed red cells andplatelets. The patient was started on C
	   VB HTG ongoing fluidand volume challenges. CVH was initially originated on [**7-
	   11**]. However, due to significantly worsening status on [**6-17**],including re
	   quiring oxygenation of 100% on the ventilator andsignificantly increased blood p
	   ressure requirements, it wasdecided in conjunction with the family after a lengt
	   hydiscussion that the patient should be made CMO. The patientexpired on [**7-18*
