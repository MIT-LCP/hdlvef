	   ia [**Last Name (un) 644**], who presentedwith SOB and has a new oxygen requirem
	   ent. She was diagnosed withMG 2-3 years ago after an episode while driving where
	    her eyelidsstarted to droop and she was unable to see (per pt's niece). Ptrepor
	   ts that she is not sure if her vision was blurry or if herlids were droopy. Pt t
	   hen had a positive what sounds like eithera Tensilon or phyostigmine test. Prior
	    to the diagnosis she hadbeen quite active, frequently playing golf. After the d
	   iagnosis,the pt's niece also noticed that Ms. [**Known patient lastname 2384**]
	   was havingtrouble with other muscles, especially having a harder timemoving arou
	   nd without using a walker,a harder time keeping herhead up. Apparently she was o
	   n chronic prednisone and mestinone,which may indicate that her symptoms were rat
	   her severe requiringaggressive treatment at baseline. Initially she took themest
	   inone qid, but she seemed to improve and her dose was cutdown to TID a year ago.
	    She was doing well on this dose, able towalk without a walker. At home she usua
	   lly walks without any assistance. When she goesout, she sometimes uses a cane. B
	   ecause she was doing well, herneurologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2385**] ([**
	   Telephone/Fax (1) 2386**], but the number is out oforder) decided to reduce her
	   mestinone to BID. After one week,her niece noticed that she was having more trou
	   ble moving withouther walker and that her eyes were drooping more. So the mestin
	   onedose was increased again to TID after 1 week. Pt denies blurryvision, swallow
	   ing difficulty, and trouble speaking..At baseline pt has mild SOB with walking.
	   At home does not useoxygen.She was not a smoker. Pt has had a gradulat weight ga
	   in overseveral years but did not have a sudden weight gain prior toadmission. Sh

	   lained of congestion and thought she might be coming downwith a virus, although
	   she denied runny nose and sore throat.That night, the pt was taken to the hospit

	   .  IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary hypertension with preserved biventricular systolic
	    function.	 Brief Hospital Course:Ms. [**Known patient lastname 2384**] was in
	   itially monitored in the Medical ICU from [**4-28**] to [**4-30**], largely due
	   to concern for respiratory decompensation given her underlying myasthenia.  She
	   was evaluated by neurology in the emergency department, and her respiratoy diffi
	   culties were thought most likely to be related to her primary pulmonary processe
	   s (pneumonia and CHF), rather than to myasthenic crisis.  Nevertheless, at some
	   point her steroid dose was increased from prednisone 15 mg daily, alternating wi
	   th 20 mg daily, to a maximum of solumedrol 125 mg TID (this was not done per neu
	   rology team).  Her pneumonia was treated with levofloxacin and azithromycin.  On
	    [**5-2**] her respiratory status worsened, so that she became increasingly hype
	   rcarbic and hypoxemic.  She was transferred back to the MICU, where she was elec
	   tively intubated due to concern for impending respiratory failure.  At that poin
	   t her antibiotics were broadened to vancomycin, flagyl, and aztreonam.  Her CHF
	   was treated with diuresis.  Neurology and Neuromuscular were re-consulted, and a
	   t this point it remained unclear whether myasthenic crisis was the major factor
	   in her respiratory failure, as the CHF and pneumonia (which on repeat CXR had be
	   come multifocal) were also major contributing factors.  Nevertheless, to be safe
	    she was started on plasmapheresis, beginning [**5-2**] p.m., for 5 treatments.
	    Her mestinon was held while she was intubated, as it can increase secretions.
	   Her respiratory status improved so that she was extubated on [**5-5**], and tran
	   sferred to the medical floor on [**5-6**].  On [**5-7**] her steroids were weane
	   d to prednisone 30 mg TID, but her mestinon was not restarted, nor was her stand
	   ing home lisinopril or lasix.  She was maintained on metoprolol for blood pressu
	   re control.	She continued to have persistent peripheral edema, crackles on lung
	    exam, and an oxygen requirement.On the morning of 5/17 Ms. [**Known patient las
	   tname 2387**] myasthenia acutely worsened.  She was unable to open her eyes or t
	   o hold up her head.	She was given mestinon 30 mg, after which her exam improved
	   , but due to the risk of impending respiratory failure (as she had significant w
	   ork of breathing) she was transferred to the Neurology ICU for close monitoring
	   and further management.  Her course in the ICU, by systems, was as follows:1. NE
	   URO:  Her prednisone was continued at the same dose, 90 mg per day.	Mestinon wa
	   s restarted at 30 mg TID.  She completed her 5 courses of plasmapheresis on [**5
	   -10**].  During her time in the ICU her neurologic status gradually improved, so
	    that her neck flexor strength improved to 4+/5 (compared to 4-/5 upon transfer
	   to the unit) and her ptosis and vertical gaze weakness improved.  She was evalua
	   ted again by the neuromuscular team, who felt that her decompensation was not li
	   kely related to the steroid wean, and agreed with restarting her mestinon and co
	   ntinuing the plasmapheresis which finished on [**5-10**].2. ID:  Her multifocal
	   pneumonia was treated with a 10 day course of vancomycin, aztreonam, and flagyl
	   (finished [**5-11**]).  Blood and urine cultures were negative.3. RESP:  Her NIF
	   's were stable at -20 (although sometimes she could not make a good seal with th
	   e machine), and vital capacity ranged from 450-600.	She continued to have crack
	   les on lung exam and received IV doses of lasix prn.  Her home po lasix was rest
	   arted at 40 mg daily, then increased to 60 mg daily.  Her O2 requirement remaine
	   d 2-4L NC.  She continued treatment with nebulized albuterol and atrovent.4. CV:
	     Home lisinopril was re-started.  The metoprolol was discontinued as beta block
	   ers can worsen myasthenia.  This plan was discussed with the medicine consult te
	   am (who recommended restarting the beta blocker when able, but from a myasthenia
	    standpoint this was not possible).	She remained peripherally edematous.5. HEME
	   :  Her hematocrit dropped significantly on the day before transfer to the ICU (f
	   rom 35 to a low of 24 on [**5-10**]), and she was transfused 2 units of PRBC's,
	   followed by 20 mg IV lasix.	Iron studies revealed severe iron deficiency anemia
	    (although her MCV was normal), and she continued her iron supplementation (325
	   mg daily) as at home.  Stool guaiac and rectal exam revealed no evidence of occu
	   lt blood.  She did have significant ecchymoses all over her body, but was receiv
	   ing subcutaneous heparin injections for DVT prevention.6. GI:  No evidence of GI
	    bleed.  Mild persistent abdominal distention since admission.  Stool regimen ma
	   intained.  Occasional, but not persistent, loose stools.  C.diff negative.7. Ren
	   al:	Mild hematuria (25-50 wbc), likely traumatic in etiology, due to Foley cath
	   eter.8. Endo:  Maintained on insulin sliding scale* * *On [**5-11**] she was tra
	   nsferred out of the ICU to the neurology floor.  Her hospital course there is as
	    follows:1. Myasthenia:  From a neurologic standpoint, her strength continued to
	    slowly improve and her medications were slowly weaned so that at discharge she
	   was taking prednisone 20 mg q AM, 30 mg q afternoon and 20 mg q PM. Mestinon was
	    maintained at 30 mg q 8 hours.  Her prednisone should be weaned over the next 1
	   -2 weeks to 20 mg tid. At discharge her NIF was -50 and her VC was 900.2. Respir
	   atory:Her respiratory status continued to stabilize.  The pulmonary service was
	   consulted while she was on the neurology service and felt that her initial respi
	   ratory failure was multifactorial including her pneumonia, atelactasis, hypovent
	   ilation, myasthenia, and volume overload.  They recommended supplementary O2 to
	   maintain her saturations above 90%.	Once she has recovered from her pneumonia s
	   he should undergo pulmonary function tests and potentially [**Initials (NamePatt
	   ern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 292**] study to evaluate the benefit of Bi
	   PAP.  She was diuresed with lasix and at discharge was taking 40 mg daily which
	   is what she was taking prior to admission.  She also continued to use standing a
	   lbuterol and atrovent nebulizers.  At rehab her respiratory status should be clo
	   sely monitored initially with frequent O2 saturation checks.3. Heme:The hematolo
	   gy service was consulted for an anemia workup which revealed anemia of chronic d
	   isease for which she was started on supplemental iron, folate, and B12.  She als
	   o had an isolated elevated PTT which was thought to be most likely due to hepari
	   n effect although, given her family history of [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
	    [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] disease, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**L
	   ast Name (NamePattern1) **] studies were sent and were pending at discharge. 4.
	   Endocrine:She was started on insulin NPH 15 bid and a humalog sliding scale to c
	   ontrol her blood sugars while she was on prednisone.  As her prednisone is weane
	   d down, she will likely require less insulin.5. Cardiovascular:Her home lisinopr
	   il was continued.  Her metoprolol was not restarted as this is contra-indicated
	   as she recovers from her myasthenia crisis.	Her lasix was continued at 40 mg po
	    daily with goal of keeping her fluid status even to slightly negative.  She sho
	   uld have electrolytes checked intermittently as she required occasional potassiu
	   m repletion.6. Access: A PICC line was placed in the left arm and a CXR confirme
	   d its placement in the SVC.7. Code status: Full code..Dispo:She was discharged t
