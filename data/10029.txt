	    ([**Hospital3 247**]) after unwitnessed fall at NH. The patient is a poor histo
	   rian and does not recall the incident. Patient is  CT head from OSH negative. No
	    focal neurologic symptoms. No localizing [**Last Name (un) 248**] of infection.
	    By report, the patient had a C6 fracture. According to the patient's son, the p
	   atient has had multiple falls in the last 1-2 years. Initially, his falls were t
	   hought to be related to a cardiac etiology and "small heart attacks". He is seen
	    by a cardiologist in [**Location (un) 249**] who sent him for defibrillator/pac
	   er placement a few months ago. He has continued to have falls since then which a
	   re usually unwitnessed and thought to be secondary to generalized weakness. The
	   patient receives hemodialysis on Mon, Wed, Fri and did receive his dialysis yest
	   erday..In the ED, the patient was found to have extensive DJD of the cervical sp
	   ine with resultant cord compression at C4-C7 and a large lytic lesion in a throa

	   ef Hospital Course:1) E.coli bacteremia. On [**11-23**] Mr. [**Known patient las
	   tname 252**] [**Last Name (Titles) 262**] a temp to 104.  Blood cultures were dr
	   awn and later grew e.coli in 2/2 bottles. Enterococcus species were found to gro
	   w in the following out in the following week. He had a positive UA and cultures
	   later grew serratia and VRE. On [**11-24**], patient was dialyzed and post-dialy
	   sis had a blood pressure of 50/P with tachycardia to 140's. He was started on le
	   vo/flagyl soon thereafter switched to Vanc/Zosyn. Gent was added per ID recs. Th
	   e patient was transferred to ICU secondary to hypotension and T 104.8.  Blood cu
	   ltures from this day grew e.coli in 2/2 bottles (making it [**5-18**] total).  A
	   ntibiotics included vancomycin, zosyn, and gentamycin. Patient was noted to be d
	   yspnic, disoriented, and confused. Vitals were T 104.8; BP 90/48; HR 148; RR 24;
	    Sa02 94% RA. Soon thereafter, vancomycin and zosyn were D/C'ed per ID recs. Gan
	   tamicin was maintained, and therapy will continue for 14 days (initiated [**11-2
	   4**]).He was taken for urgent ERCP on [**11-24**] for presumed cholangitis. Ston
	   e fragments and pus were noted to extrude from major papilla. CBD was dilated to
	    12 mm. A biliary stent was placed. Old stent was removed and sent for cytology.
	   In the ICU, he was transiently on pressors for hypotension - on [**11-25**] dose
	    of levophed was weaned down and off by [**11-26**].  On transfer AST was 26; AL
	   T 53; Amylase 66; Lipase 17. WBC was 14.4; creatinine was 4.5. Sepsis was improv
	   ed and gentamycin was maintained as sole antibiotic therapy. He was transferred
	   to floor on [**11-26**]. Follow-up blood cultures dran [**11-26**] remained nega
	   tive for bacterial growth. As noted, cultures from [**11-23**] later grew entero
	   coccus species that were sensitive to high dose gentamicin. Follow-up blood cult
	   ures recommended after gentamicin course has been finished.2) Biliary duct dilat
	   ion and stent placement, as per above.Findings included: - A previously placed p
	   lastic stent was found in the major papilla. The stent was pulled and sent for c
	   ytology.  - Stone fragments and pus were noted to extrude from the major papilla
	   .  - The CBD appeared dilated to 12 mm.  - To aid biliary drainage, a 7cm by 10F
	   r Cotton [**Doctor Last Name 261**] biliary stent was placed successfully in the
	    CBD.  - LFTs prior to the procedure were elevated [**11-23**] to ALT 79; AST 41
	   7 and fell to normal levels following ERCP. Amylase levels rose slightly in the
	   days following, suggesting mild post-ERCP pancreatitis. 3. UTI. Urine grew VRE a
	   nd serratia [**11-24**] as noted previously. Cultures of 10/10 were negative. Su
	   rveillance cultures 10/13 and [**12-1**] proved negative. Foley catheter was D/C
	   'ed without problem [**11-29**]. 4. Mental status. Mr. [**Known patient lastname
	    252**] was oriented to "self." He was oriented to "[**Location (un) **]" or "Ho
	   spital" and "[**2737-9-14**]." Toward the end of his hospital course, he was ori
	   ented to "[**Hospital3 **] Hospital." 5. CADCardiac markers were elevated (0.13,
	    0.14, 0.08) from admission.  An echo showed ejection fraction of 20-30 percent.
	    He was not cathed.	Beta blocker (metoprolol 25 mg BID po) was resumed on [**11
	   -27**], following transfer from ICU to the floor. Aspirin therapy was maintained
	   . He was successfully weaned from oxygen 2L by nasal cannula to room air. Simvas
	   tatin (40 mg) was withheld until discharge.	SaO2 on [**11-30**] p.m. was 100% 2
	   L.  6. Cord compression: CT spine showed severe spinal cord compression at the C
	   3-4 through C6-7 levels and 1.4 x 1.2 cm lytic lesion involving the T5 vertebral
	    body.  PSA was elevated.  Concern for metastatic prostate cancer was raised. In
	    addition, spinal stenosis and cord compression were noted from C5 to C7. He was
	    asymptomatic for cord compression at these levels. Neurosurgery consultation re
	   commended CT myelogram, which was performed [**12-3**] and confirmed cord compre
	   ssion. No surgical intervention, however, was warranted.  Outpatient bone scan i
	   s recommended.7. ESRD on HD and fistula clot. Patient's AV fistula was noted to
	   be thrombosed. Transplant surgery attempted thrombectomy resulted in rethrombosi
	   s after one hour. AV fistulogram [**11-30**] revealed aneurysm and impatent AV f
	   istula, and attempted re-thrombectomy by IR was also unsuccessful. Instead, a ri
	   ght internal jugular hemodialysis catheter was placed, through which Mr. [**Know
	   n patient lastname 252**] has also received his IV gentamicin. Hemodialysis was
	   performed according to renal recs (see accompanying documentation) and will be r
	   esumed per patient's usual WMF routine at the [**Location (un) 249**] dialysis u
	   nit. [**Location (un) 249**] will also arrange for further AV fistula surgery.
	   8. Anemia. Found to be macrocytic with unknown baseline but stable. Dialysis adm
	   inistered erythropoietin. Please follow-up with outpatient evaluation. 10. HTN.
	   Following patient's ICU course, his home dose of lisinopril 2.5 mg PO daily was
	   reinstated. Due to elevated blood pressures (160s/80s), the dose was increased t
	   o 5 mg daily. He was discharged with this new dose.	11. Afib. Patient remained
	   in NSR during stay.	On beta-blocker and ASA.12. Thrombocytopenia. Platelet coun
	   t on [**11-26**] was found to be 88. While patient was not receiving heparin, hi
	   s IV lines were being flushed with heparin. This was D/C'ed and assay for anti P
	   F4 antibodies was sent. This later returned negative for HIT. Platelet counts so
	   on increased to the 180s and remained stable.13. Other prophylaxis. DVT prophyla
	   xis was maintained with pneumoboots. Reflux prophylaxis was maintained with prot
