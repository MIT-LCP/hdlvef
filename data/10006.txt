	   LE. CT abdomen:1) Thickened wall in long segment of sigmoid colon, consistent wi
	   th diverticulitis, unchanged. There is a small amount of interlooped free fluid
	   in the pelvis, not amenable to drainage.2) Pelvic fluid collection, of uncertain
	    origin, that was aspirated from [**9-24**] and shown to be not contaminated, an
	   d unchanged.TTE: Moderate aortic regurgitation and minimal aortic stenosis but n
	   o discrete vegetation seen (does not exclude). Regional left ventricular systoli
	   c dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild mitral regurgitation.	Compared with the prior stu
	   dy (tape reviewed) of [**2946-6-30**], left ventricular systolic function is now
	    depressed (40%). The severity of aortic regurgitation is similar.  CXR: Right j
	   ugular dialysis catheter is in right atrium. PICC line is in SVC, partly obscure
	   d by the dialysis catheter. Linear atelectases are present in both lower zones.
	   No pleural effusion. Degenerative changes are present in the thoracic spine and
	   in the glenohumeral joints bilaterally. Surgical clips are present in the right
	   upper quadrant status post cholecystectomy.	Brief Hospital Course:A/P: Ms. [**K
	   nown patient lastname 46**] is a 70 year old women with ESRD on HD who presents
	   with fever to 103, chills, and tachycardia to 103 with possible line infection.
	   .1.	Sepsis:  The patient was initially sent to the intensive care unit under th
	   e sepsis protocol. She was started on vancomycin for skin flora and unasyn for G
	   roup D enterococcus (VRE) sensitive to amp (previous infections over last year).
	    Her blood cultures drawn at [**Location (un) 47**] grew out oxacillin resistant
	    coag negative staph. Her urine cultures were without grown.  A CXR was obtained
	    and was without signs of pneumonia. Once she was stabilized, Ms. [**Known patie
	   nt lastname 46**] was sent to the floor where her tunneled catheter was removed.
	    The tip was sent for culture but did not grow any organisms.Access was an issue
	    as 3 attempts in ED failed, including one with US. Instead a PICC was placed an
	   d eventually, after she was free of bacteria for > 48 hours, a new tunnel line w
	   as placed. Despite placement of a new line and clean surveillance cultures, Ms.
	   [**Known patient lastname 46**] continued to spike fevers. She spiked through he
	   r vancomycin which was always re-dosed when her daily levels fell below 15. An a
	   bdominal CT was obtained, revealing a 7 cm mass, consistent with an abscess, abo
	   ve the bladder. Considering that she had been recently hospitalized with a diver
	   ticulitis and peritonitis, it seemed urgent to intervene on this "abscess". It w
	   as evacuated under IR guidance but no organisms appeared on gram stain and nothi
	   ng grew on culture. It became apparent that this was most likely a fluid collect
	   ion from the patient's peritoneal dialysis. The patient continued to spike fever
	   s so a work up was commenced that included a chest x ray, a TTE (since she has a
	    murmur, although old) and more blood and urine cultures. All these studies were
	    negative. As the patient continued to spike fevers and had one bout of emesis,
	   another abdominal CT was obtained. It showed diverticulitis and so a 14 day cour
	   se of flagyl and levofloxacin was started. It was decided that a general surgery
	    consult would be obtained once she was an outpatient in order to faciliate rese
	   ction of the affected length of bowel. At discharge, Ms. [**Known patient lastna
	   me 46**] was instructed to continue her levo, flagyl, and vanco to complete a 14
	    day course of each one. Her vanco levels were to be followed and redosed at HD.
	   .2.	ESRD:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 46**] usually dialyzes on Tues, Thurs,
	    Sat but here she was switched to Monday, Wednesday and Saturday under the guida
	   nce of the renal team. Her electrolytes were followed and repleted very consevat
	   ively as needed. It was noted that her phosphate calcium product was quite high,
	    so her sevelamer was titrate up. She was also placed on a renal diet. The patie
	   nt reports making urine, however not an adequate measure of perfusion due to ESR
	   D. She hopes to continue her peritoneal dialysis and felt were upset at having t
	   o start HD. The method of dialysis was to be further addressed as an outpatient
	   with her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **], after
	   her diverticular disease was resolved. .3.  DMII:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname
	    46**] is usually on oral hypoglycemics. These oral agents were held due to thei
	   r long half life and instead she was covered with RISS with QID finger sticks. H
	   er home regimen of glipizide was restarted at discharge. While in house, she was
	    on a controlled carbohydrate diet..4.  HTN:  Ms.[**Known patient lastname 53**]
	    home regimen includes metoprolol, moexipril and diltiazem. Initially the metopr
	   olol was continued and the diltiazem and moexipril were held since the patient i
	   s currently not hypertensive. Before discharge, she was restarted on moexepril b
	   ut not diltiazem. She was also started on an aspirin and atorvastatin before dis
	   charge..5.  Afib:  The patient is on coumadin as outpatient for anticoagulation.
	     This was hold anticoagulation in case she required urgent line placement.	Her
	    rate was easily controlled with beta blocker. Before discharge, her coumadin wa
	   s restarted, but very cautiously as it interacts with her 2 antibiotics for her
	   diverticulitis, flagyl and levofloxacin. She was advised to have her INR followe
	   d carefully and her warfarin titrated as needed for an INR [**12-24**]. .6.	CAD
	    by hx (fixed perfusion defect) but clean coronaries by cath:  The patient was c
	   ontinued on metoprolol but given her current anticoagulation status and possible
	    need for urgent line placement the aspirin was held.  Her ACE inhibitor and sta
	   tin were initially held and re-started later in her course. Medications on Admis
